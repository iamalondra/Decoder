This project demonstrates my ability to build tricky algorithms as well as write unit tests with Mocha and Chai.

## Ceaser
The Caesar shift is a type of substitution cipher originally used by Julius Caesar to protect messages of military significance. 
It relies on taking the alphabet and "shifting" letters to the right or left, based on the typical alphabetic order.

## Polybius
The Polybius square is a cipher that is achieved by arranging a typical alphabet into a grid. Each letter is represented through a coordinate. 

## Substitution
The substitution cipher requires a standard alphabet and a substitution alphabet. 
Letters from the standard alphabet will be transposed to the standard alphabet.
